## Background

In my part-time job, many customers frequently exhibit confidence in their vehicles, asserting they can tow anything. A few years ago, the company implemented an update to the system, mandating us to take pictures of the towing vehicles for safety reasons during rentals. However, there seems to be a lack of consideration from the customer's perspective regarding potential risks. As a customer myself,  I recognize that often we focus on achieving our objectives without thoroughly considering the potential downsides, especially since vehicles are primarily viewed as tools to accomplish tasks.
